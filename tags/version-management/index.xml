      <description>Does your product support multiple versions of a particular language? Older versions of that language? (I feel you bruh)
I work on a product which supports multiple versions of python. Now don’t get me wrong, python is an amazing language. Currently, we are supporting 2.7.x and 3.3.x.
Like that wasn’t enough, there are a few hair-ripping changes from versions &amp;lt; 2.7.9 which I discovered recently. SSL is a total wreck in 2.</description>

      <description>After goofing around the last month, I suddenly had multiple bugs thrown at me. Well it came as a relief actually, since I was getting real bored of watching TV shows everyday.
The Situation Alright so these guys here have a different way of working on the code base than the way I previously experienced in my internship.
So we have a bug, and a main branch on to which our fix should go to.</description>
