      <description>Personalized Page Ranking Page Ranking Algorithm was briefly described in the previous post. The previous few posts experimented with the used of PPR in recommendations and relevance feedback. In this post, classification of images is attemped using PPR.
Can we even classify images using this algorithm? PPR is a graph algorithm that can be used to find the importance of nodes in the graph. So how can this algorithm be used to classify images?</description>

      <description>Page Ranking Algorithm Page Ranking Algorithm was briefly described in the previous post This post details experimenting with relevance feedback using PPR.
Using feedback from the user to fine tune our Recommendations We already have our graph from before.
In this scenario, we assume we have some sort of preferences of the user. Maybe the user has viewed some images before and marked some of the images as relevant and some as irrelevant.</description>

      <description>Page Ranking Algorithm Page Ranking Algorithm is a graph-based algorithm. It’s an interesting technique to learn of the importance of nodes in a graph. Not only that, this algorithm can be modified to do cool things like finding importance based on custom criteria.
This semester, I learnt about Page Ranking in a graduate course called “Multimedia and Web Databases”. It’s a project heavy course, and it gives a good opportunity to experiment different use cases with different algorithms.</description>

      <description>Non-Negative Matrix Factorization I recently took the course “Multimedia and Web Databases” and we learnt to use feature reduction techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the multimedia data. This is done so that we can scan the entire database (relatively) fast for approximately similar data.
One of our project tasks involved using NMF to find top ‘k’ images closest to a given image in the Euclidean space. Our project can be found here.</description>
