      <description>So the QA is like: We cannot sign off on the release of the product cuz of these bugs! And the Dev is all like: I cannot reproduce these bugs!
Must be a Deja vu for many.
We don&amp;rsquo;t know who or what is wrong. It could be an anomaly on the Dev&amp;rsquo;s environment or in the QA&amp;rsquo;s environment. Safe to say, we not only need to reproduce the code for the bug, we also need to be able to reproduce the same environment to locate the actual reason for these bugs.</description>

      <description>I am a developer. I don’t care about testing. – The young developer
 Of course it starts like that. And right when you are presenting your project in front of others, you realize that the feature isn’t working. My god, what a terrifying situation.
Then you realize the importance of testing. You find out about the different types of testing, and how you wish that you had written tests for each feature/fix you committed so that the problem would have been caught immediately.</description>
